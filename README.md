I. Introduction
I recently completed the Google Project Management Professional Certification and am excited to share my capstone project. I took on the role of Peta, a newly hired Project Manager at Sauce & Spoon, overseeing the pilot launch of tabletop menu tablets in two restaurant locations. This project provided a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate the skills and methodologies I gained throughout my project management training.

II. Project Overview
Sauce & Spoon, a small restaurant chain, aimed to improve efficiency and customer service as part of its growth strategy by introducing tabletop menu tablets. These tablets would allow guests to place orders directly, reducing wait times and providing valuable data to help the restaurant meet its business goals.

III. Project Initiation
As the first in-house project manager, my primary responsibility was overseeing the tablet rollout. I began by developing the project charter and evaluating key stakeholders. This included meeting with restaurant management and staff to assess their needs and expectations for the project.

IV. Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholders had varying perspectives on the tablet rollout. Omar, the owner, initially wanted to expand the scope to all dining sections, but the project was confined to the bar area for the pilot. Through stakeholder negotiations, I worked closely with Deanna, the Director of Operations, and others to ensure a smooth implementation within the project's scope.

V. Project Planning
In the planning phase, I identified key tasks and milestones to ensure the project remained on track. I drew inspiration from past projects and industry research to improve the tablet rollout. Collaborating with team members like Seydou (Technical Consultant) and Gilly (General Manager), I developed a comprehensive project plan covering everything from staff training to technical support.

VI. Project Execution
The tablet launch was carefully executed with the focus on meeting quality standards and ensuring staff were well-trained. After the launch, customer satisfaction surveys were distributed, and feedback was collected to assess the pilot’s success.

VII. Project Closing
After analyzing survey data and holding retrospective meetings, the project team completed the tablet rollout at both locations. The test launch resulted in improvements, such as reduced wait times and increased customer satisfaction. A detailed impact report was presented to senior stakeholders, including Omar and potential investors.
